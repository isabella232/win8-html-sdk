	In this example you can see how to bind RadScheduler to a local SQLite database using the Telerik Data Storage component. In the scheduler above you can create, delete and update events 
    and they will be stored locally on your device. If you restart the example, the created events will be there again. This feature is useful if you wish to provide offline support for your 
    scheduler application.
