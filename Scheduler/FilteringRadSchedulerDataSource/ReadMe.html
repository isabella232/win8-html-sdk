	This example shows how you can filter a RadScheduler's dataSource based on the boolean values of checkbox input elements. The scheduler is loaded with concerts 
    events and city resources. On top of the RadScheduler there are a number of checkboxes with image labels and upon change the scheduler's dataSource is filtered 
    based on the selection.
