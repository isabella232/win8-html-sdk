<p>
	This example demonstrates conditional formatting in RadGrid. The prices in the control are colored in red if they are greater than 7, otherwise they
are colored in green. Also, if there is a discount, it is displayed with green background.

<p>
	The different text color is achieved using a template in the Price column, which returns different content, based on the price. The background is
set using a style attribute for the column cells which value is dynamically determined .
