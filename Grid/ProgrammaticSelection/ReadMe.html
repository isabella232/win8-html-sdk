	This sample shows how you can programmatically select rows in RadGrid. To see it work, click the button under the grid and alternating rows
will be selected.

<p>
	The example uses the <strong>selection</strong> property of RadGrid to achieve its goal. The property can be set to the DOM elements of the
rows (cells, if cell selection is enabled) that need to be selected. The alternating rows are selected by their class name and assigned to it.
