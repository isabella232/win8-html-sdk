<p>
	To create a hierarchical RadGrid, you need to define a <strong>detailTable</strong> object in the RadGrid constructor and assign it a data source and
	parent relation. The relation should list two fields: <strong>masterField</strong> which is the field from the master grid used for the relation and 
	<strong>detailField</strong> which is the field from the detail grid that links to the master field.
