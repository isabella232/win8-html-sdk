<p>This example shows how to display controls inside a RadGrid column. In this scenario, a RadChart is displayed in the second column.</p>
<p>
	The scenario is achieved by using cell template for the column, where a template function is called. The data item of the current row is passed to it
and the chart options are build in accordance with the available data. Afterwards, the options are stringified and returned inside an HTML wrapper
definition. In the <strong>databound</strong> event of RadGrid, <strong>processAll()</strong> is called for its element, so the nested controls can be
instantiated.
