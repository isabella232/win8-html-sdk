<p>
	In this example RadGrid is bound to XML from an external file (but stored in the project). You can take a look at the Books.xml file to examine the
layout of the data.

<p>
	To achieve such binding you need to properly define your dataSource. In the <strong>transport</strong> options specify the path to the file. Then, 
	in the <strong>schema</strong> options, specify the schema type of the file and which XML element represents a single data record. Lastly, define a 
	model, which describes the fields that you want to use. Note that you can use nested objects as data fields for the grid columns. One limitation is
	that you cannot bind to XML that uses namespaces, as it cannot be correctly parsed.
