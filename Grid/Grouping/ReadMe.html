<p>This example demonstrates RadGrid grouping. Drag a column header to the service column to group by its field.</p>
<p>
	After setting your data source accordingly, you just need to set the <strong>groupable</strong> property to either <em>"enabled"</em> or 
<em>"enabled, staticHeaders"</em>. Both enable grouping but the second enables the static headers feature, where the headers of the currently scrolled group
stays static on top of the scrollable area.
