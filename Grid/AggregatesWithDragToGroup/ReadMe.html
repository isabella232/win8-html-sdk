	In this example you can see how you can show group aggregates in RadGrid after any of its fields is grouped. Drag a column header to the grouping 
panel on the left to see the result.

	Aggregates are defined by first listing them in the dataSource and then setting the <strong>aggregates</strong> and 
	<strong>groupFooterTemplate</strong> properties of the column that contains the aggregated data field.
