<p>
	This example shows how to display a progress indicator, when RadGrid's initial loading time is longer than normal (for example when querying large
sets of data).
</p>
<p>
	The scenario is achieved by changing the visibility of a progress element, using a CSS class which applies a <em>display:none</em> style.
	 The progress is shown, by removing the <em>hidden</em> class just before the RadGrid definition. Then, in the <strong>databound</strong> event of 
	 the grid control, the progress is hidden.
