<p>
	This example shows a RadGrid bound to the CNN RSS feed. Three categories are listed in a ListView control. Upon invoking one of the listview items, RadGrid is 
	bound to the relevant feed. Note that the DataSource used to bind RadGrid should be recreated each time the feed changes because the DataSource <strong>transport</strong>
	options cannot be modified after the component is already initialized.
