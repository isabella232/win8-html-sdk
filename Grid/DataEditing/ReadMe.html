	This example demonstrates a basic editing scenario in RadGrid. It shows how the model of the data source should be set to allow editing and, when needed, to set
some limitations on the entered data. Since you need to make sure that newly inserted items have an id, the save event of RadGrid is handled to demonstrate one way to 
manually set the id of a data item.
