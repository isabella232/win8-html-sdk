	This example shows how you can set up the virtual scrolling feature of RadGrid. It allows you to display large sets of data in the control and scroll
through them. 
</p>
<p>
	To enable the feature you should perform three simple steps: 1) set the <strong>scrollable</strong> property to <em>"virtual"</em>; 2) set the
height of the grid to an appropriate number (corresponding to the rows height and number of visible rows); 3) if you bind RadGrid to a remote service 
that returns already paged data, make sure that you set the number of overall records, using the <strong>total</strong> property of the DataSource.
