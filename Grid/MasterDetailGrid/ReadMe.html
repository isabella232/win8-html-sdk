<p>This example shows two RadGrid controls in a master-detail relation. Select a row in the first grid to see detail information in the second.</p>
<p>
	The scenario is achieved by using the <strong>change</strong> event of the first grid. On selection change, the data item of the selected row is
accessed and used to fetch the data needed to populate the second grid. The second grid auto-binding is disabled, so that it can be bound on demand 
when a row from the master grid is selected.
