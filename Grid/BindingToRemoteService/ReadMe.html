<p>
	This example shows how you can bind RadGrid to data requested from a web service. This is completely set in the dataSource. The web service URL is
specified, along with the type of the expected response. To correctly treat the fields, a model is defined, listing each field that is going to be used
and its data type. This is especially important when you are going to perform operations like sorting and filtering of data, where the data type is
important for the behavior of the operation.
