<p>
	This example shows how to implement checkbox selection in RadGrid. To display the checkboxes, define a template for the first column. Then, handle 
	the click event of the row to prevent default selection and of the checkboxes to manually select the row whose checkbox was checked by the user.
	To implement "select/deselect all" functionality, define a header template with a checkbox for the same column and handle its click separately.
	Additionally, note that you should hide the select handle displayed by default by RadGrid for better user experience (done in CSS).
