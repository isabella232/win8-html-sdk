<p>
	In this example RadGrid is bound to JSON from an external file (but stored in the project). You can take a look at the BooksJSON file to examine the
layout of the data.
</p>

<p>
	To achieve such binding you need to properly define your dataSource. In the <strong>transport</strong> options specify the path to the file and
the data format.Then, in the <strong>schema</strong> options, specify the schema type of the file and which JSON object represents a 
single data record. Note that you can use nested objects as data fields for the grid columns.
