<p>
	This sample shows a RadComboBox requesting data from an OData service. Start typing in a company name from Northwind's Customers data, 
	e.g. "Chop-suey Chinese". The filter applied will be "contains", instead of the default "starts with".
</p>
<p>
	The call to the remote point is done by the underlying <strong>Telerik.Data.DataSource</strong> component. You just need to specify the settings
	for the request and the location of the needed data items in the response. For RadComboBox, you need to set a <strong>dataTextField</strong>
	pointing to the data field in the response used to display text from, and a <strong>dataValueField</strong> which will populate the items values.
