<p>This example demonstrates RadZoomable - a component used to wrap HTML or entire controls, so that they can be used with the WinJS SemanticZoom.</p>
<p>
	To provide a zoomed in and zoomed out view in this example, we use two RadZoomable components and wrap with them a RadCustomHubTile and a 
RadChart. When all this is put inside the SemanticZoom, you can zoom in and out between the two controls.
