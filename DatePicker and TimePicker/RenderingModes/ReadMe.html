	This sample demonstrates the two rendering modes of the picker controls. When in the standard one, the pickers display a text box and a button by 
	default and when one of the two is clicked/tapped, the picker component shows up. When the mode is inline, only the picker part is displayed, it 
	is always visible and is a part of the page flow.
