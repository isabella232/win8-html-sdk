<p>
	You can customize the content of autocomplete suggestions by specifying a template for them. Start typing in a company name from Northwind's 
	Customers table, e.g. "Chop-suey Chinese" to see the templated suggestions.
</p>
<p>
	This example uses <strong>WinJS.Binding.Template</strong> instance for the autocomplete suggestions. You can also use a string with binding 
	expressions or a function returning a string/DOM element.
