<p>This example shows a RadCustomHubTile displaying text and images coming from a remote point.</p>

<p>
	The scenario is achieved by making an xhr request to the eBay OData service to access the latest deal, and creating a hubtile populated with
this data. The RadCustomHubTile is initialized after the response is returned and its back content template is populated with the already
available information (only the image needs to be loaded from the given url).
