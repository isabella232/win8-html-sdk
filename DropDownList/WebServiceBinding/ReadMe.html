<p>
	This sample shows a RadDropDownList requesting data from an OData service. Click on the text area or the button to trigger the dropdown with all 
	available options.
</p>
<p>
	The call to the remote point is done by the underlying <strong>Telerik.Data.DataSource</strong> component. You just need to specify the settings
	for the request and the location of the needed data items in the response. For RadDropDownList, you need to set a <strong>dataTextField</strong>
	pointing to the data field in the response used to display text from, and a <strong>dataValueField</strong> which will populate the items values.
