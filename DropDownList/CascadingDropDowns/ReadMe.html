<p>
	This example shows how to create a cascading dropdowns scenario - when you select an item from the first RadDropDownList, the second is populated
	with related data. 
</p>
<p>
	The scenario is achieved by capturing the <strong>change</strong> event of the first RadDropDownList (Regions) and filtering the dataSource of the 
second (Territories) based on the currently selected region.
