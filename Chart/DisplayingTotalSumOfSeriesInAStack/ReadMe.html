<p>
	This sample shows how to display the total sum of stacked data points from different series. 
</p>
<p>
	By default the series label displays only the value of its corresponding data point. The desired result here is achieved by using a custom parsing
	function in the RadChart dataSource. It traverses each data item and sums the values of the two fields (which are used to populate the two series).
	Then, the calculated value is assigned as a new property of the parsed data item. To display this total value inside the label, we use a template and
	access data from its binding context.
