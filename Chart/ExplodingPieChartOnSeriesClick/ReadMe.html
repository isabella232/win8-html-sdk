	This sample shows how you can explode a pie chart sector on clicking it. 
</p>
<p>
	This effect can be achieved if you construct your chart data source to contain an additional field, which is used to indicate whether a sector
	should be exploded. On clicking a sector, all sectors' <em>Highlighted</em> value is set to <em>false</em>, to make sure they do not get exploded and only the
	current one's <em>Highlighted</em> value is changed to <em>true</em>. RadChart is then refreshed to reflect the changes.
