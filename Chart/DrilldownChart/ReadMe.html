	This sample shows a drill down chart. At first it displays summarized data on year basis, but if you click one of the data points (columns), the
	chart will display 12-month break-down of the data.
</p>
<p>
	The scenario is achieved by handling the <strong>seriesclick</strong> event of the chart and modifying the series data (by filtering the chart
	data source, using the year from the clicked data point) and the category axis' base unit (from 'years' to 'months'). You can drill deeper
	 by changing the base unit to 'days' and filtering the data, based on the current month.
