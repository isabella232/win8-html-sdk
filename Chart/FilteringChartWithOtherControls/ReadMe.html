	This example shows how you can filter RadChart using external controls. The RadTokenInput filters the athletes included in the visualization while the RadRangeSlider
	allows you to choose the number of olympic medals that may be displayed. This is implemented using the filtering capabilities of the DataSource component used to
	bind the RadChart control. Additionally, the RadTokenInput layout is modified to make it easier to view and remove items when many values are selected.
