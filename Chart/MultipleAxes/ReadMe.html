	This sample shows a chart with three value axes. Each has a corresponding series and for easier orientation the matching axes and series use the
same color.
</p>
<p>
	To be able to assign a specific axis to a series in your chart, give the axis a <strong>name</strong> and then assign the same value to the 
	<strong>axis</strong> property of the series.
